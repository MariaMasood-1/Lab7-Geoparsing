# Geoparsing with Python

In this lab, we used Nominatim which is a gazetteer to extract spatial coordinates out of a text based input. This process is called geoparsing. As explained by the lab tutorial, Geoparsing is a specific kind of procedure known in geography as toponym resolution. However, we derive location value from structured data using Toponym resolution while geoparsing recognizes that the input data is ambiguous and unstructured like extracting information from text. We used text data from the project Gutenberg “Kill me if you can '' book, extracted the city names from the book, converted the names to spatial coordinates and plotted the latitude and longitude values on the map.

Since the setting of the book is around 1859, the city specific data may not be relevant in current times. For example, the city Smyrna (City in Turkey) is called Izmir now while it’s plotted on the map and the frequency distribution curve, there might be other major places that may have gone missing. It might be helpful to take into the account the abbreviated city names as well to avoid missing out on important city names. It might also be helpful to implement Natural Language Processing to extract the textual contents of the input, and analyse the grammatical structure of the texts to understand the context of the sentence which helps avoid extracting city names that were not meant as city names in the input file.
